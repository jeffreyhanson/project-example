# Observation data

This directory contains spider hole observation data. These data were collected during 2016 by students of the Field Ecology course at The University of Queensland. The data were collected over two weeks -- with each week containing a different group of students -- and within a given week, the students were organized into different groups (i.e. the group names were blue, green, red, and yellow).
